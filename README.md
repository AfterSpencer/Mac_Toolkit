# Mac Toolkit
Combination tool for migrating users, adding administrator accounts, and resetting local keychain.

This project is a combination of other projects I have worked on. The tasks it can accomplish are to migrate user data either from one computer to another (or from a share) or to move user data from one account to another on the same computer.

I added the option to run other tools as part of this project. On the first dialog the option for Other Task will show the options for Set Admin which lets a user account be set as Administrator, and Fix Keychain which will fix the keychain for an AD user (or other user) who had their password reset somewhere other than in System Preferences.
